# **The Vernito Journey**

![Hero Image](hero.webp)

## In 2015, a vision began…

**Vernetic** was born—a robust, fully featured CSS framework built to empower developers with precision and flexibility. For nearly a decade, it evolved, grew, and tackled complex design challenges.

But as the web matured, so did the need for something different: **simplicity without compromise**.

### **Enter Vernito**
The minimalist counterpart to Vernetic. At just **9KB compressed (53KB uncompressed)**, Vernito is the distilled essence of its sibling, designed for those who crave **speed, clarity, and freedom from bloat**.

---

## **Why Vernito Exists**

✅ **Lightning-fast adoption** – No sprawling features. Only what you need to start coding immediately.

✅ **Proven foundation** – Built on lessons from Vernetic’s **8+ years of refinement**, but stripped to its core.

✅ **Unopinionated flexibility** – No design dogma. **Vernito gives you tools, not rules**—craft interfaces your way.

## **For Developers, By a Developer**

Vernito is for:

- **Prototyping ideas** without fighting a framework.
- **Legacy projects** that need a modern touch, fast.
- Anyone who’s ever thought, **“I just want CSS to stay out of my way.”**

## **What Builders Say**

> “Vernito feels like coding with HTML again—simple, direct, no surprises.”

> “I use Vernetic for complex apps, but Vernito is my go-to for everything else.”

> “Finally, a ‘mini’ framework that doesn’t make me miss the features of larger tools.”

## **The Vernito Ethos**

This isn’t just a stylesheet—it’s a philosophy. We believe:

- **Size matters** – 9KB means your users wait less, engage faster.
- **Evolution, not revolution** – Vernito inherits Vernetic’s maturity but carves its own path.
- **The web deserves better** – Less dependency chasing, more creating.

## **Get Started in Seconds**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tompapatolis/vernito.git
```

No build steps. No configuration. Just **add `vernito.css` and watch your HTML come alive**.

---

## **Two Frameworks, One Family**

Vernito stands on the shoulders of Vernetic—its battle-tested sibling. **Together, they cover the spectrum:**

- **Vernetic**: For ambitious, feature-rich applications.
- **Vernito**: For elegance in minimalism.

---

## **Contribute & Evolve**

This is **open-source at its purest**. **Break it. Extend it. Or just use it.** Every line of code, issue filed, or idea shared **keeps the spirit of simplicity alive**.
